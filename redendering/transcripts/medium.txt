Chapter 7: Unexpected Echoes

The old library smelled of dust and chocolate—an odd combination that seemed to linger in every corner. Anna traced her fingertips along the spines of ancient tomes, wondering which secrets she'd uncover today. She heard an echo behind her, like an indistinct murmur, yet when she turned, there was no one in sight.

For a moment, she questioned her own sanity—was it just a trick of the acoustics, or had someone really whispered her name? Her pulse quickened; memories flooded back of ghost stories from her childhood, each tale ending with that same chilling echo. She took a deep breath and continued deeper into the stacks, resolving to find answers.

A sudden gust rustled a nearby page, revealing a strange code: 4d2f-6a7c-8b1e-92f0—a hyphenated cipher that defied explanation. Why would someone leave such a message on a book bound in weathered leather?

Anna hesitated, then reached out to touch the page. Her fingertips grazed the ink, and the lights flickered.

…

(Several moments passed in silence, broken by stifled breaths and the occasional squeak of floorboards.)

She pulled out her notebook, writing down every detail:

- The code: 4d2f-6a7c-8b1e-92f0  
- An empty photo frame, dust-coated but intact  
- Three consecutive blank lines in an otherwise continuous paragraph

Why these specific anomalies? She didn't know yet, but she was determined to find out.

By now, the library clock struck midnight. Anna felt a mix of dread and excitement. Tomorrow, she would return with reinforcements, yet something told her she had to unravel this mystery on her own. The echo beckoned, and she couldn't resist answering.
